# Sticky Header Library

## Overview

**The Sticky Header Library** is a simple JavaScript function that enables a sticky header effect on web pages. When scrolling down, the header remains fixed at the top, providing a consistent navigation experience.

## Features

- **Easy to implement** with minimal code.
- **Lightweight and efficient.**
- **Compatible with modern web browsers.**

## Installation

You can install the file and use it in your projects


### Directly in HTML

You can directly embed the JavaScript function in a `<script>` tag within your HTML file.

# Example
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/muizzgull/stickyHeader/stickyHeader.js"></script>

### External JavaScript File

1. Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `stickyHeader.js`) and add the function.
2. Include the script in your HTML file.

## Usage

1. Add a header element in your HTML with a specific class name, such as **"header."**
2. Call the `stickyHeader` function, passing the class name of your header.
3. Ensure you have appropriate CSS styles for the sticky effect.
4. Ensure that you add a class to your header even if it is "Header" element. Else it will not work.

## Example

For a complete example of how to use the Sticky Header Library, refer to the demo provided in the library documentation or create a simple HTML structure with a header and content.
